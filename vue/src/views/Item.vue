        <p>Anguirus (アンギラス Angirasu) is a giant Ankylosaurus kaiju who first appeared in the 1955 Toho Godzilla film Godzilla Raids Again. 
            Anguirus was Godzilla's first-ever opponent, and battled him to the death in Osaka in Godzilla Raids Again. Anguirus was ultimately killed by Godzilla, but a second individual debuted in the film Destroy All Monsters in 1968. 
            This Anguirus became a friend and ally to Godzilla, loyally fighting alongside him to fend off alien monsters such as King Ghidorah and Gigan. Anguirus' final appearance in the Showa series of films came in 1974's Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, where he had his jaw broken by the alien machine Mechagodzilla, who was masquerading as Godzilla. Anguirus' next film appearance came 30 years later in Godzilla Final Wars, where he was a mind-controlled pawn of the Xiliens in their invasion of Earth. More recently, Anguirus has appeared as a skeletal carcass during the prologue of GODZILLA: Planet of the Monsters and as an enemy fought by Jet Jaguar in the anime series Godzilla Singular Point, along with numerous other appearances in video games and comic books. While not as popular as the likes of Rodan, Mothra or King Ghidorah, Anguirus has become a popular monster in his own right, and has earned a reputation as being both Godzilla's closest friend and as a tenacious fighter even when severely outmatched.</p>
